<h2 id="why-did-i-add-this">Why did I add this?</h2>
<p>Sketch of the first chapter.</p>
<p>Young man going to the University of Chicago. He’s a programming
student. He’s being recruited by a big AI tech firm, which is secretive
and lucrative - everybody wants in with them - but they don’t accept
applications. They only recruit. What is the name of this outfit?
[[Obscrye]]</p>
<p>The scene opens with the young man getting finished with class. It’s
almost winter break. His family lives in Wisconsin, somewhere on a small
farm. His girlfriend is a biologist. She’s in grad school - and will be
going into life sciences, her specialty is in longevity.</p>
<p>He’s talking to his friend about what he’s going to do back home. His
friend is athletic, they like to workout together - very competitive
friendship. His friend is being recruited as a quant, but he wants to
get into Obscrye. He’s jealous.</p>
<p>What’s the main character’s name? [[James Wilson]]. What’s his
friend’s name [[Ricky]]? What’s his girlfriend’s name? [[Lucia]]</p>
<p>There’s going to be a big end of term party at a party house on
Chicago’s south side - [[Wicker Park]]. But James can’t go. His older
sister just had a kid, and she and her family will be at the family home
and they have a plan that they do every year to have a special trip to
[[Door County]] - this is where they are killed, btw.</p>
<p>So he’s going to miss the party.</p>
<p>His girlfriend is going to go. His best friend is going to go. He
can’t go.</p>
<p>He gets out of class. It’s snowing hard. A little insight into his
life. He is meticulous about tracking his life. His workouts, his diet,
his planning.</p>
<p>It’s snowy and there’s a group of thuggish types hanging at the
corner. He walks by them, they laugh at him and call him a nerd - he
jokes back with them. He has no fear. He’s a funny white boy.</p>
<p>He gets to his apartment and packs. He goes through his nightly
ritual of burpees, pullups, and journals. It’s lights out by 11PM.</p>
<p>He wakes up and texts Lucia. She doesn’t answer. He wants to take her
to a breakfast cafe place that is popular, he tells her he’ll even break
his diet for her. No answer. No read.</p>
<p>He’s kind of pissed, he goes by her apartment. She’s not there. Her
roommate says she didn’t come home last night.</p>
<p>He texts Ricky. Ricky doesn’t know where she is either. He says he’ll
keep a look out.</p>
<p>James waits around for a few more hours. Nothing.</p>
<p>His mom calls. Puts his sister on the phone. The background noise is
warm and busy. He hears his newborn niece crying. His sister asks when
he’ll make it. James says today.</p>
<p>He grumbles about Lucia. 18 months into this relationship and she
ghosts him the day before he’s going to be gone for a week.</p>
<p>Whatever. He’s done well before her. And besides, if she won’t want
to move to San Francisco with him - she’s being invited to Austin, TX
for a hot new health-tech startup, whose founder seems a bit cultish,
too - then they’re gonna break up anyways.</p>
<p>So he starts driving. Describe some of the drive up [[Highway 41]]
(this becomes a common theme, a road, a route between this world and the
next - what’s the significance of Highway 41?).</p>
<p>He finally gets to his family home, which is in [[Ripon, Wisconsin]]
- not far from the cookie factory. It’s an old farm house, rebuilt by
his father who’s a carpenter [[James Sr.]], who’s known as Pops.</p>
<p>His mom works at Ripon University.</p>
<p>There’s already a conflict when he arrives. His sister’s husband -
something happens to him - is it a joke? His brother-in-law’s family
opens a small burger chain in southwestern Wisconsin and Iowa.</p>
<p>Whatever he’s done pisses off James and his dad.</p>
<p>Chapter ends. James is glad to be home.</p>
