<p><em>James is dreaming…</em></p>
<p>Then he sees the face of Imhotep / the bum who stabs him. They’re the
same person.</p>
<p>Then he sees the face of the person who stabbed his family. He
laughs. It’s a different person, but they look similar. Are they the
same people or different? I actually don’t know.</p>
<p>James wakes up.</p>
<p>He gets up and needs to find Imhotep.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-5">Chapter 5:</h3>
<p>This is where [[James Wilson]] meets [[Tiya]]. He’s one of the first
people he bumps into. She is captivating. She is in the market and darts
off - he only meets her later at [[Imhotep]]’s house.</p>
<p>James walks through the market. This is a scene setting chapter. He
gets to know the daily life of Egyptians here.</p>
<p>He walks by the riverside. There is a market here. Scarabs, amulets,
baked breads. Everything is simple and clean.</p>
<p>There are grand villas with ornate balconies. White-washed palaces.
Temples to various gods, chants, processions of priests.</p>
<p>Workshops, blacksmiths. Gardens. Canals. Different workshops with
skilled men absorbed in their craft. Mud brick makers.</p>
<p>There is a temple to the god Ptah (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptah">Ptah - Wikipedia</a>, who also
happens to be the mythological father of [[Imhotep]].)</p>
<p>There are two castes that are very easy to easy.</p>
<p>There is a small group of laborers - there are two of them, [[Du’un
&amp; Da’am - the twin pair of laborers]] singing and getting drunk. One
man is blind. The other, half-crippled. They laugh and joke and slap
each other on the back.</p>
<p>They invite James for a drink. They admire his strength. They arm
wrestle together. James notices that he is bigger than most everyone
here, but they end up being much stronger. He beats two of the men -
barely - and he faces the final one: the blind, crippled man.</p>
<p>When losing, James must drink a whole jug of wine. It is warm and
sour. They clap and laugh and sing as he drinks the wine. He finishes
the jug and wants to throw up. The men laugh and bring him down to the
back of a house, with an unkempt garden near a canal. He pukes there and
comes back. The guys all think it is very funny.</p>
<p>Then they play Senet. They line up a makeshift board on the ground.
They make the dirt into mud by pouring water, then they carve out the
squares and symbols. The one laborer does it with care and precision
with a ceremonial type knife - a beautiful knife with a scarab in the
handle.</p>
<p>They place the pawns and then they toss small bones (<a href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/G_1894-1101-559">knuckle-bone;
gaming-piece | British Museum</a>) to determine the count of how much
they move. The men are absorbed in the game. They are betting on the
moves, making side bets, and then a larger bet for the winner. A small
crowd forms around them - street kids and other laborers.</p>
<p>James wants to play but has no buy-in or ante. What can he put up? He
reaches for his black stone pendant - and it’s gone. (The black stone
pendant is something he picked up from the house when his family was
killed in [[Chapter 2 - Sketch]], mention it then - and then [[Imhotep]]
steals it - so James doesn’t have it anymore - so he wants to track it
down from him.)</p>
<p>What else does he have? He has his wallet. No cash. But he does have
a credit card. He puts it down. The laborers grab it and examine it.
They find the material fascinating - plastic - the first time they’ve
encountered a plastic card. They move their thumb across the embossed
numbers. They accept it as an ante.</p>
<p>James plays the game of Senet. He’s behind at first by a lot. More of
observers gather around. His opponent - [[Qar]], who is a royal - bets
more, James must match his bet. He puts another credit card in. Then
another bet - and what else does he have? A photo of [[Lucia]]. He puts
that in. The people are shocked and wondered at how a picture could look
so real.</p>
<p>The opponent tries to cheat.</p>
<p>James wins the game and wins the pot. He upsets his opponent, a
challenger - a large man, who is angry but can’t do anything. James now
has various jewelry - gold bracelet, necklace, a scarab pendant, and an
anklet. The loser is angry and storms off - he comes back later as
[[Qar]] and tries to kill James. He also has affections for Imhotep’s
niece [[Tiya]], and this is a point of further contention between these
two - which is revealed later.</p>
<p>James is congratulated by the three laborers for beating the royal.
They tell him he is welcome back any time. They want James to drink more
but he declines, laughing as the laborers make pretend to thrown up.</p>
<p>James wanders off. It’s dusk now. There’s a beautiful scent in the
air. The sky is the color of red wine. There are boats floating down the
Nile. Up ahead he sees something on the horizon. Thousands of people,
all dressed in simple white cloth, streaming towards one place. They all
carry tools and are strong, young men. They chant a worker’s type song,
all in unison, all stepping the same.</p>
<p>Up ahead - James sees it. The men are carving out the [[Sphinx]].</p>
<p>It is a profound vision. It finally hits James that he is in another
time and place. He is witnessing history unfold.</p>
